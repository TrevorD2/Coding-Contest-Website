# Coding-Contest-Website
A simple website to host programming competitions with a built-in code editor and dynamic leaderboard.

I challenged myself to complete this project within a week, so while it's functional, there may be rough edges. However, it's easily expandable for future improvements.

Contestants can choose problems that the host creates and submit code through the built-in editor. Contestants can also create custom test cases in order to check their code without having to submit.

Features a dynamic leaderboard that updates in real time as the contest continuesâ€”ranking contestants based on their score. A timer is also included that ends the contest automatically when the timer reaches zero.
